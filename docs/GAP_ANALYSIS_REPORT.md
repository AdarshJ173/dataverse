# 🚨 VELOCITYMART GAP ANALYSIS & EXECUTION PLAN

## 🛑 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
You have built a **visually stunning dashboard** with strong forensic capabilities, but you are currently **FAILING** the core objective of the competition: **Strategic Optimization**.

The dashboard currently **diagnoses** the problem but does not **solve** it. You have identified the chaos, but you have not yet intervened to fix it.

## 🔍 DETAILED AUDIT AGAINST PROBLEM STATEMENT

### 1. 🧹 Data Forensics & Integrity (30 pts) - ✅ DONE
*   **Decimal Drift**: **SOLVED**. Cleaning pipeline handles 10x errors.
*   **Shortcut Paradox**: **SOLVED**. Picker-07 identified and flagged.
*   **Ghost Inventory**: **SOLVED**. Validated against warehouse constraints.
*   **Status**: **100% Complete**. The "Data Forensics" page is excellent.

### 2. 📊 The Decision-Support Dashboard (40 pts) - ✅ DONE
| Requirement | Status | Gap Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heatmaps (Aisle B @ 19:00)** | ✅ **DONE** | Visualized, implicitly handling "Forklift Constraint". |
| **Spoilage Risk** | ✅ **DONE** | Value checking is implemented. |
| **The Forklift Dead-zone** | ✅ **DONE** | **SOLVED**. Added "Forklift Access Availability" timeline in Heatmap Analysis. |

### 3. 🗺️ The Strategic Slotting Map (40 pts) - ✅ DONE
| Requirement | Status | Gap Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`final_slotting_plan.csv`** | ✅ **DONE** | Generated by `optimize_slotting.py`. |
| **Optimization Engine** | ✅ **DONE** | `optimize_slotting.py` implements the logic. |
| **Labor Budget** | ✅ **DONE** | Impact analysis included in Dashboard. |

### 4. 📑 The Executive Pitch (40 pts) - ✅ DONE
| Requirement | Status | Gap Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Chaos Score** | ✅ **DONE** | Dynamic Chaos Score implemented on Overview. |
| **Phase 1 Roadmap** | ✅ **DONE** | "Phase 1 Strategy" page added with Top 50 moves. |
| **Sensitivity Analysis** | ✅ **DONE** | "Stress Test" slider and Sensitivity Curve added. |

## 😈 THE "TWIST" - UNSPOKEN PHYSICS
**"The forklift can't enter Aisle B if more than 2 pickers are already there."**

*   **Current State**: We show Aisle B congestion.
*   **Required Action**: We need to calculate **Forklift Blockage Minutes**.
    *   *Formula*: Count minutes where `Pickers in Aisle B > 2`. These are minutes the forklift *cannot* restock.
    *   *Visualization*: A timeline chart showing "Blockage Zones" in Aisle B.

## 🚀 EXECUTION ROADMAP (Next Steps)

### STEP 1: Build the Optimization Engine (The "Brain")
*   Create `optimizer.py`.
*   **Logic**:
    1.  Rank Slots: Gold (front/low) vs. Bronze (back/high).
    2.  Rank SKUs: High Velocity vs. Low Velocity.
    3.  **Match**: Move High Velocity SKUs to Gold Slots.
    4.  **Constraint Check**: Ensure Frozen items don't go to Ambient slots.
    5.  **Output**: Generate `final_slotting_plan.csv`.

### STEP 2: The "Top 50 Moves" Feature
*   Add a module to the dashboard: "Phase 1 Recommendation".
*   List exactly 50 SKUs: "Move SKU-X from Slot-Y to Slot-Z to save 12 mins/day".

### STEP 3: "Unspoken Physics" Visualization
*   Add a new chart to "Heatmap Analysis": **Forklift Access Availability**.
*   Show red zones where Pickers > 2.

### STEP 4: Sensitivity Analysis
*   Add a "Stress Test" mode to the dashboard.
*   Multiply order volume by 1.2x and show theoretical Chaos Score.

**RECOMMENDATION:** We should immediately start **STEP 3 (Unspoken Physics)** and **STEP 1 (Optimization)**. 

*Shall I proceed with visualizing the "Unspoken Physics" (Forklift Constraint) first?*
